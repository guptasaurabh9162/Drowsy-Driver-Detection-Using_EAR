# Drowsy-Driver-Detection-Using_EAR
This project implements a real-time drowsiness detection system to enhance driver safety. Utilizing the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method, it identifies when a driver's eyes are closed, indicating potential drowsiness, and provides an alert. The system employs OpenCV for image processing and Haar cascades for face and eye detection.
